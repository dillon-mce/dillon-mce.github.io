I am basically just beginning my journey as a professional developer. Since August of 2018 I have been studying iOS Development at Lambda School, with a brief hiatus where I acted as the section lead of a later cohort for a few months. If you’d like to look at some code I’ve written recently, [check out my GitHub](https://github.com/dillon-mce).

For the six years prior to that I was the technical director at a couple of different churches and I’ve been [a photographer on the side](http://light-and-lens.com) for the last few years. I’ve noticed that a lot of the skills I’ve picked up doing those things seem to be transferable to programming. You have to be able to read documentation. You have to be able to learn stuff for yourself. You have to figure out how to solve problems in creative (and sustainable, and repeatable)  ways. And you have to think about the user’s experience every step of the way. I’m looking forward to applying those skills to whatever job comes next!
