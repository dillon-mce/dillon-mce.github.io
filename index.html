<p> Welcome to my website. This is where I put the things I write about that I am learning at the moment. A lot of it is probably boring and not all that well written, but hey, no one is forcing you to read it all. I just needed an outlet/excuse to write some stuff, so if anyone finds any of it beneficial that is totally a bonus. Feel free to peruse at your leisure or move on if this isn't the place for you. And if you have any feedback (preferably constructive), go ahead and send it to any of the links over there to the left. Thanks!</p>
