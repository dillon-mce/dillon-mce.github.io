I spent basically all day every day for nine months reading and writing Swift and learning how to build iOS apps.</p><p>Ten days after finishing that course, I started a job at <a href="https://www.madwire.com/">Madwire</a> working on their <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/top-rated-local/id1270356201?uo=4">Top Rated Local</a> app. We used a modified version of the <a href="https://clean-swift.com/">VIPER architecture</a>, shot for 100% code coverage with our unit tests and generated all our UI programmatically so I got a crash course in all three of those things there.</p><p>After that I joined <a href="https://home.ibotta.com/">Ibotta</a>, working on their <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ibotta/id559887125">iOS app</a> as a part of the Radicial Simplification team. Our goal was to reduce friction as much as possible for the users of the app by showing them (only) content they care about and removing unnecessary roadblocks in the process of earning rewards. I got to work with some incredible people and learned a lot about iOS architecture and working cross-functionally in a large organization while I was there.</p><p>Most recently I accepted a position as Lead iOS Developer at <a href="https://hallow.com">Hallow</a>, a prayer and meditation app. At Hallow I am responsible for the iOS app, maintaining the code base, establishing best practice and releasing new features and bug fixes on a regular cadence.</p><p>I have also been <a href="http://light-and-lens.com">a photographer/videographer in my free time</a> for the last several years. I’ve noticed there is a surprising amount of overlap between doing those things and software development. You have to be able to read documentation. You have to be able to learn stuff for yourself. You have to figure out how to solve problems in creative (and sustainable, and repeatable) ways. And you have to think about the user’s experience every step of the way. I enjoy applying those skills to the work I do now, and I'm sure they'll serve me well for whatever comes next!</p><blockquote><p>"Dillon has a clear attention to detail, which is a trait that is very hard to find (or train). He thinks through problems patiently, has a knack for noticing edge cases, and also seems like an amiable and friendly person to work with. He was able to answer every theoretical question and solve every problem I asked him to solve without any issue…" – Antonio Tari, <a href="https://www.skilledinc.com/report-card/2103">Skilled Interview</a></p></blockquote><h2>Previous Employers</h2><p><strong><a href="https://hallow.com">Hallow</a> - Lead iOS Engineer | 06/21 - Present</strong> Hallow (pronounced like aloe) is a prayer and meditation app, focused primarily on audio experiences that help promote spiritual, mental and physical growth.
