      <description>I ran into this cool little piece of functionality in Xcode the other day that helped me solve a real problem. I have never seen anyone mention that you can do this, so I&amp;rsquo;m sharing it here in the hopes that it will help someone else out.
I was recently working with a framework which uses a configuration file. This file is stored in JSON and is bundled with the app.</description>

      <description>We all know how it goes when we are trying to get something working. We want to get there as fast as we can and we get focused on the &amp;ldquo;happy path&amp;rdquo;. Maybe we&amp;rsquo;re not that familiar with the technology/language/concept, but we have one specific goal or task we are trying to achieve and we don&amp;rsquo;t care so much about the edge cases or what will happen when things go wrong.</description>

      <description>If you have been an iOS developer for any length of time, you have certainly come across bugs that are hard to understand and hard to track down. And if you have an app out in the world that real human beings use you have probably encountered a bug or crash that is happening for some subset of your users, but that you cannot for the life of you reproduce on your device.</description>
