title: "Day 81 - 100 Days of Swift"
tags: 100days swift
excerpt: "Day 81 is the second part of the twenty-fourth project. You review the material you covered yesterday and then he gives you a few challenges to work through on your own. He challenges you to add an extension that adds a prefix to a `String`, if it doesn’t already have it. He challenges you to add an extension that is a calculated property which returns whether a `String` is numeric. And he challenges you to add an extension that returns an array of `String` which is the individual lines of the `String` it is called on."

## Project 24 (part 2)
[Day 81](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/81) is the second part of the twenty-fourth project. You review the material you covered yesterday and then he gives you a few challenges to work through on your own. He challenges you to add an extension that adds a prefix to a `String`, if it doesn’t already have it. He challenges you to add an extension that is a calculated property which returns whether a `String` is numeric. And he challenges you to add an extension that returns an array of `String` which is the individual lines of the `String` it is called on.

The first one is basically just the reverse of one of the extensions we wrote yesterday:
```
extension String {

    /// Returns the string, ensuring that it has the given prefix
    func withPrefix(_ prefix: String) -> String {
        guard !self.hasPrefix(prefix) else { return self }
        return prefix + self
    }
}

print("pet".withPrefix("car"))    // prints "carpet"
print("carpet".withPrefix("car")) // prints "carpet"
```

The second one is a simple matter of checking whether you can initialize a `Double` from the `String`. Because this was so simple, I decided to take it a little farther and use one of the techniques from yesterday to check if _any_ of the letters in the `String` is a number:
```
extension String {

    /// Returns true if the whole string is a number
    var isNumeric: Bool {
        return Double(self) != nil
    }

    /// Returns true if any character in the string is a number
    var hasNumeric: Bool {
        return self.contains { Double("\($0)") != nil }
    }
}

print("1.74".isNumeric)         // prints true

print("OneTwo3Four".isNumeric)  // prints false
print("OneTwo3Four".hasNumeric) // prints true
```

For the third one, I just returned the result of a call to `components(separatedBy:)`:
```
extension String {

    /// Returns an array of strings separated by new lines
    func lines() -> [String] {
        return self.components(separatedBy: .newlines)
    }
}

print("this\nis\na\ntest".lines())
// prints ["this", "is", "a", "test"]
```

Short and sweet today. Nothing too complex, mostly just looking stuff up in the documentation. I could see some of these extensions being useful at some point though, so I’m glad I took the time to think through them.
