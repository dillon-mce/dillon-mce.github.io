title: "Day 65 - 100 Days of Swift"
tags: 100days swift
excerpt: "Day 65 is the second part of the eighteenth project which, again, involves writing very little code since it is about debugging. You do a review and then he gives you three “challenges”, which are pretty much just illustrations of how you might debug something. He challenges you to add an exception breakpoint in Project 1 and then force it to throw an exception by giving it a bad identifier to instantiate a view controller from. He challenges you to add an `assert` that will verify that there is a `selectedImage` in the `DetailViewController` in Project 1. And he challenges you to add a conditional breakpoint to the start of the `submit` method, that will trigger if the user submits a word with six or more letters."

## Project 18 (part 2) 
[Day 65](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/65) is the second part of the eighteenth project which, again, involves writing very little code since it is about debugging. You do a review and then he gives you three “challenges”, which are pretty much just illustrations of how you might debug something. He challenges you to add an exception breakpoint in Project 1 and then force it to throw an exception by giving it a bad identifier to instantiate a view controller from. He challenges you to add an `assert` that will verify that there is a `selectedImage` in the `DetailViewController` in Project 1. And he challenges you to add a conditional breakpoint to the start of the `submit` method in Project 5, that will trigger if the user submits a word with six or more letters.

For the first one, I just added an exception breakpoint in the breakpoints window and changed the identifier in `tableView(_:didSelectRowAt:)` to `"Bad"`. When I ran the app and tapped on a cell it paused because an exception was thrown and it looked like this:

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/100days/2019-08-03-exception-breakpoint.png" alt="Screenshot of an exception breakpoint being caught"%}

For the second challenge I just added this line in `DetailViewController.swift`:
```
// In viewDidLoad()
assert(selectedImage != nil, "We should never be on this view without an image.")
```
It runs just fine because everywhere we are instantiating a `DetailViewController`, we are also passing a `selectedImage`. That may change in the future though, so it doesn't hurt to check.

And for the third, I added a breakpoint at the beginning of `submit()` and gave it the condition `answer.count >= 6`. When I ran it in the app and submitted a word with fewer than 6 letters, it didn’t pause, but when I submitted a word with more than one letter it paused on that line. It looked like this:

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/100days/2019-08-03-conditional-breakpoint.png" alt="Screenshot of a conditional breakpoint being caught"%}
