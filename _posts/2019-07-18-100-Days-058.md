## Project 15 (part 2)
[Day 58](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/58) is the second part of the fifteenth project. It is really going back and applying some animations that you learn in project 15 to some of the previous projects. He challenges you to make the letter buttons fade out when they are tapped in project 8. He challenges you to fade the image in when a new one is selected in project 13. And he challenges you to animate the flag to scale down when it is tapped in project 2.

To make the letter buttons fade out I added an animation to take the `alpha` to 0 when the button is tapped on, and then another to take it back to 1 when the user hits “Clear”, and I reset it to 1 when the user levels up:
```
// In letterTapped(_:)
UIView.animate(withDuration: fadeDuration) {
    sender.alpha = 0
}

// In clearAnswer(_:)
UIView.animate(withDuration: fadeDuration*2) {
    for button in self.activatedButtons {
        button.alpha = 1
    }
}

// In levelUp()
for button in letterButtons {
    button.alpha = 1
}
```

One issue with this was the built in animation for tapping on a `UIButton` didn’t look great in combination with this animation, so I got rid of the built in one by making the button a `.custom` button and setting its color programmatically:
```
// In loadView(), where we are making the buttons
let letterButton = UIButton(type: .custom)
letterButton.setTitleColor(.systemBlue, for: .normal)
```

That results in an animation that looks like this:

To fade in the image in project 13, I first animated the `alpha` to zero when the user hits the add button (so that it fades out the previous image if there is one), then I animated it back to 1 when the `imagePickerController` is dismissed. I also reset it if the `imagePickerController` is cancelled:
```
// In importPicture()
UIView.animate(withDuration: 0.1) {
    self.imageView.alpha = 0
}

// At the end of imagePickerController(_:didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo:)
dismiss(animated: true) {
    UIView.animate(withDuration: 0.5) {
        self.imageView.alpha = 1
    }
}

// In imagePickerControllerDidCancel(_:)
imageView.alpha = 1
dismiss(animated: true)
```

That gives an animation that looks like this:

To animate the flags in project 2, I turned off `adjustsImageWhenHighlighted` for all the buttons, because it is no longer necessary, and then put pretty much all of `pickFlag(_:)` in the completion closure for the animation:
```
UIView.animate(withDuration: 0.3,
               delay: 0,
               usingSpringWithDamping: 0.5,
               initialSpringVelocity: 1,
               options: [],
               animations: {
    sender.transform = CGAffineTransform(scaleX: 0.8,
                                         y: 0.8)
}) { _ in
    sender.transform = .identity
    self.answered += 1
    if sender.tag == self.correctAnswer {
        self.score += 1
        self.askQuestion()
    } else {
        self.score -= 1
        self.presentWrongAnswerAlert(country: self.countries[sender.tag].uppercased())
    }
}
```

That gives an animation that looks like this:
