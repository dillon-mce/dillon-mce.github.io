excerpt: "Day 79 is the third part of the twenty-third project, where you review what you’ve learned and he gives you a few challenges to polish up the game. He challenges you to clean up your code a little bit, removing some of the magic numbers from the `createEnemy` method. He challenges you to create a fast-moving type of enemy that is worth extra points. And he challenges you to add a “Game Over” once when the player loses all their lives."

## Project 23 (part 3)
[Day 79](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/79) is the third part of the twenty-third project, where you review what you’ve learned and he gives you a few challenges to polish up the game. He challenges you to clean up your code a little bit, removing some of the magic numbers from the `createEnemy` method. He challenges you to create a fast-moving type of enemy that is worth extra points. And he challenges you to add a “Game Over” node once when the player loses all their lives.

The first challenge I did to a level I was satisfied with as I followed along with his code in the first place. So I didn’t really change much on that front today.

For the second challenge I first added a new enemy type in `createEnemy`:
```
var enemyType = Int.random(in: 0...7)

// in the big if statement
else if enemyType == 7 {
    enemy = SKSpriteNode(imageNamed: "penguin")
    run(SKAction.playSoundFileNamed("launch.caf",
                                    waitForCompletion: false))
    enemy.name = "bonus"
}

let xPositionRange = enemy.name == "bonus" ? 520...760 : 64...960
let randomX = Int.random(in: xPositionRange)

let yVelocityRange = enemy.name == "bonus" ? 48...64 : 24...32
let randomYVelocity = Int.random(in: yVelocityRange)
```

Then I made sure to destroy it in `touchesMoved`:
```
switch node.name {
case "enemy", "bonus":
    destroyPenguin(node)
case "bomb":
    destroyBomb(node)
default:
    break
}
```

And update the score in `destroyPenguin`:
```
let modifier = node.name == "bonus" ? 5 : 1
score += modifier
```

Then I just needed to remove them if they fall off screen. I decided I didn’t want the player to lose a life for missing these guys, because they sometimes fly off screen pretty quickly, so I grouped them in with the bombs for the logic in `update`:
```
else if node.name == "bombContainer" || node.name == "bonus" {
    node.name = ""
    node.removeFromParent()
    activeEnemies.remove(at: index)
}
```

For the third challenge, I just set up a `gameOverLabel`:
```
let gameOverLabel: SKLabelNode = {
    let node = SKLabelNode(fontNamed: "Chalkduster")
    node.horizontalAlignmentMode = .center
    node.fontSize = 120
    node.text = "Game Over!"
    node.setScale(0.001)

    node.position = CGPoint(x: 512, y: 384)

    return node
}()
```

And then added it when the game is over:
```
addChild(gameOverLabel)
let scaleAction = SKAction.scale(to: 1.0, duration: 0.5)
gameOverLabel.run(scaleAction)
```

I also wanted to give the user the ability to restart the game without having to force quit the app, so I pulled some of the logic out into a new `restartGame` method:
```
func restartGame() {
    isGameEnded = false

    gameOverLabel.removeFromParent()
    gameOverLabel.setScale(0.001)

    activeEnemies.forEach { $0.removeFromParent() }
    activeEnemies.removeAll()

    popupTime = 0.9
    sequencePosition = 0
    chainDelay = 3.0
    nextSequenceQueued = true
    physicsWorld.speed = 0.85
    score = 0

    createLives()

    sequence = [.oneNoBomb,
                .oneNoBomb,
                .twoWithOneBomb,
                .twoWithOneBomb,
                .three,
                .one,
                .chain]

    let possible = SequenceType.allCases
    (0 ... 1000).forEach { _ in
        if let nextSequence = possible.randomElement() {
            sequence.append(nextSequence)
        }
    }

    DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 2)
    { [weak self] in
        self?.tossEnemies()
    }
}
```

And then called it in `didMove(to:)` and `touchesBegan`:
```
// End of didMove(to:)
restartGame()

// Beginning of touchesBegan
guard !isGameEnded else {
    restartGame()
    return
}
```

With all that done, it leads to a game that looks like this:
