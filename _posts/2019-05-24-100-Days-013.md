## First Review Day
[Day 13](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/13) is the first review day. You review [constants and variables][day1]. You review [data types][day1] and [operators][day3] and [string interpolation][day1]. You review [arrays and dictionaries][day2]. And you review control flow with [if statements, switch statements][day3] and [loops][day4].

You make constants with the `let` keyword and variables with the `var` keyword. Their type is either inferred from what they are assigned to, or explicitly set with a type annotation:
```swift
let lastName = "Bluth" // This is inferred to be a String

var age: Int = 42
```

Swift has several built in types available for you to use. `String`, `Int`, `Float`, `Double`, and `Bool` are the common ones:
```swift
var firstName: String = "Lindsey"

var numberOfChildren: Int = 1

var publicAge: Float =  29.0

var realAge: Double = 37.0

let madeAHugeMistake: Bool = true
```

There are also some built in operators. There are mathematical operators, assignment operators, comparison operators, and so on:
```swift
// Mathematical
1 + 2 // 3
8 - 3 // 5
5 * 9 // 45
6 / 2 // 3
8 % 3 // 2

// Assignment
var num = 5
num += 11 // 16
num -= 2  // 14
num *= 6  // 84
num /= 2  // 42

// Comparison
2 > 5  // false
5 >= 4 // true
3 < 6  // true
4 <= 2 // false
4 == 4 // true
4 != 5 // true
```

You can “interpolate” objects into a string by putting it in `\()`. String interpolation is a fancy way of saying that you can inject a string representation of an object into a string, even though it isn’t necessarily a string itself:
```swift
let name = "Tobias"

print("\(name): \"I just blue myself\"")
// Tobias: "I just blue myself"
```

Arrays are a collection of objects of the same type. They are are accessed by index:
```swift
var bluths = [
    "Michael",
    "George Michael",
    "George Sr.",
    "Lucille",
    "Buster",
    "Lindsey",
    "Gob",
    "Maebe"
]

let imprisoned = bluths[2] // "George Sr."
```

Dictionaries are a collection of key-value pairs. You can access the value by the key:
```swift
var placesThereAreMoney: [String: Bool] = [
    "Sudden Valley": false,
    "Bluth Company": false,
    "FakeBlock": false,
    "Banana Stand": true
]

// There's always money in the banana stand...
let canGetMoney = placesThereAreMoney["Banana Stand"]
```

If you only want to run a block of code based on some condition, you can do that with an `if` statement. You can check for multiple separate conditions with `else if`, and you can provide a default for all other cases with `else`:
```swift
var careerOver = true
let needsAJob = true
let actingWorksOut = false

if careerOver && needsAJob {
    tobiasBecomesAnActor()
    careerOver = false
} else if !actingWorksOut {
    trainWithCarlWeathers()
} else {
    giveUpOnLife()
}
```

You can loop a fixed number of times with a `for` loop, and you can loop until some condition is met with a `while` loop:
```swift
for bluth in bluths {
    print("\(bluth): \"I made a huge mistake...\"")
}

// Michael: "I made a huge mistake..."
// George Michael: "I made a huge mistake..."
// etc...

let isGeorgeMicahelInLoveWithMaebe = true

while isGeorgeMicahelInLoveWithMaebe {
    georgeMichaelTriesToKissHisCousin()
}
// This will loop forever right now.
// Try to avoid that.
```

Related to the `if` statement is the `switch` statement. It lets you check multiple cases in a concise way. The compiler will also strictly enforce that all possible cases are covered:
```swift
for bluth in bluths {
    switch bluth {
    case "George Sr.", "Lucille":
        print("\(bluth) is in the older generation")
    case "Michael", "Lindsey", "Gob", "Buster":
        print("\(bluth) is in the middle generation")
    case "George Michael", "Maebe":
        print("\(bluth) is in the younger generation")
    default:
        print("I don't know who that person is.")
    }
}

// "Michael is in the middle generation"
// "George Michael is in the younger generation"
// etc...
```

## Reflections
Phew. I did not realize how much effort this 100 Days of Swift undertaking would be. Sure. It’s only an hour or two a day. But it is an hour or two *every* day. And that definitely starts to wear on you. I’m glad he had the foresight to build some rest and review days into the schedule. I can’t say that I learned anything new this time around, but as always, it is good way to refresh my memory on these basics.
