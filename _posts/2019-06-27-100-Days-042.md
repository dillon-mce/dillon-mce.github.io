excerpt: "Day 42 is is the first part of the tenth project. It will be an app that displays photos of people in a collection view, along with their names, to help you remember who’s who. Today, you get the project set up, you lay out the custom cell and make a class for it, and you get the collection view data source methods implemented in a very basic way."

## Project 10 (part 1)
[Day 42](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/42) is is the first part of the tenth project. It will be an app that displays photos of people in a collection view, along with their names, to help you remember who’s who. Today, you get the project set up, you lay out the custom cell and make a class for it, and you get the collection view data source methods implemented in a very basic way.

First, you make a new project, replace the default `UIViewController` in the storyboard with a `UICollectionViewController`, embed it in a `UINavigationController` and set it as the initial view controller. You add a `UIImageView` and a `UILabel` to the cell, and get them laid out:

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/100days/2019-06-27-storyboard.png" alt="Screenshot of storyboard showing collection view controller and cell with image and label."%}

You make a custom class for the `UICollectionViewCell`, set the cell in the storyboard to it, and add outlets for the image view and the name label:
```
class PersonCollectionViewCell: UICollectionViewCell {

    @IBOutlet var imageView: UIImageView!
    @IBOutlet var nameLabel: UILabel!

}
```

Then, in `ViewController`, you add the necessary `UICollectionViewDataSource` methods:
```
override func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView,
                             numberOfItemsInSection section: Int) -> Int {
    return 10
}

override func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView,
                             cellForItemAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> UICollectionViewCell {
    guard let cell = collectionView.dequeueReusableCell(withReuseIdentifier: "PersonCell",
                                           for: indexPath) as? PersonCollectionViewCell else {
        fatalError("Unable to dequeue a PersonCollectionViewCell. Check for typos")
    }

    return cell
}
```

If you aren't able to cast the dequeued collection view cell as a `PersonCollectionViewCell`, then you crash because it most likely means that you have a typo somewhere or that something got disconnected in the project. And that’s it for today. Here’s what it looks like so far:

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/100days/2019-06-27-working-app.png" alt="Screenshot of working app in its current state."%}

## Reflections
Today was real short. He spent most of the time talking through how to layout a cell, and how to make a custom class for one. And then comparing `UITableViewDataSource` and `UICollectionViewDataSource`. Big topics, I guess, but they didn’t lead to very much code being written. I’m looking forward to seeing it come together tomorrow.
