excerpt: "Day 49 is the second part of the twelfth project. Today you redo the work you did yesterday using Codable instead of NSCoding, which is a lot simpler. Then he gives you three challenges to go back to  some of the earlier projects and add persistence to them. He challenges you to keep track of a count of how many times each storm has been viewed in project 1. He challenges you to modify project 2 to save the user’s high score and give them a special alert if they beat it. And he challenges you to basically save the game state in project 5, so that if the user closes the app, it will come back with the game they were previously playing."

## Project 12 (part 2)
[Day 49](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/49) is the second part of the twelfth project. Today you redo the work you did yesterday using `Codable` instead of `NSCoding`, which is a lot simpler. Then he gives you three challenges to go back to  some of the earlier projects and add persistence to them. He challenges you to keep track of a count of how many times each storm has been viewed in project 1. He challenges you to modify project 2 to save the user’s high score and give them a special alert if they beat it. And he challenges you to basically save the game state in project 5, so that if the user closes the app, it will come back with the game they were previously playing.

First you use `Codable` to add persistence to project 10:
```
class Person: NSObject, Codable {
```

Then the `save()` and `load()` functions look slightly different from yesterday, because they now use `JSONDecoder` and `JSONEncoder`:
```
private func save() {
    let jsonEncoder = JSONEncoder()
    if let savedData = try? jsonEncoder.encode(people) {
        UserDefaults.standard.set(savedData,
                                  forKey: "people")
    } else {
        print("Failed to save people.")
    }
}

private func load() {
    let defaults = UserDefaults.standard

    if let savedPeople = defaults.object(forKey: "people") as? Data {
        let jsonDecoder = JSONDecoder()

        do {
            people = try jsonDecoder.decode([Person].self,
                                            from: savedPeople)
        } catch {
            print("Failed to load people:\n\(error)")
        }
    }
}
```

Those are the only differences, and the app looks exactly the same.

For the first challenge I added a `viewCounts` dictionary and `save()` and `loadViewCounts()`  methods to `ViewController`:
```
viewCounts: [String: Int] = [:]

func save() {
    UserDefaults.standard.set(viewCounts, forKey: "viewCounts")
}

func loadViewCounts() {
    if let savedViews = UserDefaults.standard.dictionary(forKey: "viewCounts") as? [String: Int] {
        viewCounts = savedViews
    }
}
```

Then I added one to the view count each time an image is presented:
```
// In didSelectRowAt
let imageName = pictures[indexPath.row]
viewCounts[imageName, default: 0] += 1
save()
```

Added the view count in the `detailTextLabel` of the `cell`:
```
// In cellForRowAt
cell.detailTextLabel?.text = "Views: \(viewCounts[imageName, default: 0])"
```

And reloaded the table view each time the view is loaded:
```
override func viewWillAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
    super.viewWillAppear(animated)

    tableView.reloadData()
}
```

With that, it tracks the views and it looks like this:

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/100Days/2019-07-08-working-project1.png" alt="Screenshot of Project 1 working with view counts"%}

For the second challenge I just get the saved high score before resetting the game and check it agains the current score. If the current one is higher, I set the new high score and present an alert:
```
// In resetGame
let highScore = UserDefaults.standard.integer(forKey: "highScore")
if score > highScore {
    UserDefaults.standard.set(score, forKey: "highScore")
    presentHighScoreAlert(new: score, prev: highScore)
}
```

The alert looks like this:
```
private func presentHighScoreAlert(new: Int, prev: Int) {
    let alertController = UIAlertController(title: "New High Score!",
                                            message: "New high score: \(new)\nPrevious high score:\(prev)",
                                            preferredStyle: .alert)

    let action = UIAlertAction(title: "Cool!",
                               style: .default)
    alertController.addAction(action)

    present(alertController, animated: true)
}
```

And when it is done it looks like this:

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/100Days/2019-07-08-working-project2.png" alt="Screenshot of Project 2 with new high score alert."%}

For the third challenge, I first added this `save()` function to the `GameController`:
```
private func save() {
    let userDefaults = UserDefaults.standard
    userDefaults.set(usedWords, forKey: "usedWords")
    userDefaults.set(startWord, forKey: "startWord")
}
```

Then I call that method when the user successfully adds a word and when we start a new game:
```
// at the end of checkAnswer
usedWords.insert(lowerAnswer, at: 0)
save()

// at the end of startGame
save()
```

Then in `init()` I pull out those values and store them:
```
// Pull saved info out
startWord = UserDefaults.standard.string(forKey: "startWord") ?? ""
usedWords = UserDefaults.standard.array(forKey: "usedWords") as? [String] ?? []
```

Finally, I just needed to make a small change the logic in `ViewController`. I split `startGame` into two functions, one that updates the views and one that starts a new game and then calls `updateViews()`:
```
@objc func startGame() {
    gameController.startGame()
    updateViews()
}

func updateViews() {
    title = gameController.startWord
    tableView.reloadData()
}
```

Then I just call the one that makes sense in `viewDidLoad`:
```
if gameController.startWord != "" {
    updateViews()
} else {
    startGame()
}
```

With that, it looks the same but it remembers the word you were working on and the words you had guessed, even after restarting the app.
