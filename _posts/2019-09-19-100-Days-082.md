excerpt: "Day 82 is a consolidation day where you review projects 22 through 24. After reviewing some of the key points from those projects, including using `CLLocationManager`, `UIBezierPath` and `extension`.  Then he challenges you to write some extensions of your own. He challenges you to write an extension on `UIView` that animates a view down to `0.0001`  over a given duration. He challenges you to write an extension on `Int` that will take a closure and run it as many times as the `Int`. And he challenges you to write an extension on `Array` that lets you remove a given item from it."

## Consolidation IX  
[Day 82](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/82) is a consolidation day where you review projects 22 through 24. After reviewing some of the key points from those projects, including using `CLLocationManager`, `UIBezierPath` and `extension`, he challenges you to write some extensions of your own. He challenges you to write an extension on `UIView` that animates a view down to `0.0001`  over a given duration. He challenges you to write an extension on `Int` that will take a closure and run it as many times as the `Int`. And he challenges you to write an extension on `Array` that lets you remove a given item from it.

For the first one I just added a function that takes a duration and a completion closure and animates the view out over that duration:
```
typealias EmptyClosure = () -> Void

extension UIView {
    func bounceOut(duration: TimeInterval, completion: ((Bool) -> Void)?) {
        let animations: EmptyClosure = {
            self.transform = CGAffineTransform.identity.scaledBy(x: 0.0001, y: 0.0001)
        }
        UIView.animate(withDuration: duration,
                       delay: 0,
                       animations: animations,
                       completion: completion)
    }
}
```

For the second one, I just used `forEach` to run the given closure as many times as the `Int`:
```
extension Int {
    func times(closure: EmptyClosure) {
        (0..<self.magnitude).forEach { _ in
            closure()
        }
    }
}

let str = "Hello"
3.times { print(str) }
// Prints:
// "Hello"
// "Hello"
// "Hello"
```

For the third one, I constrained the `Element` to be `Equatable` and then used the array’s `firstIndex(of:)` method to find and remove the element:
```
extension Array where Element: Equatable {
    @discardableResult
    mutating func remove(_ item: Element) -> Element? {
        guard let index = firstIndex(of: item) else {
            return nil
        }
        return self.remove(at: index)
    }
}

var arr = [1, 2, 3, 4 , 5, 1]
print(arr) // prints [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]
arr.remove(1)
print(arr) // prints [2, 3, 4, 5, 1]
```

And that’s it for today. Another short and sweet one in the bag!
