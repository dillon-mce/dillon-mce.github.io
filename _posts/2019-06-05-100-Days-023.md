excerpt: "Day 23 is a consolidation day where you review the first three projects.  You review a bunch of the material covered in the first three projects, but I won’t reiterate it here. He also gives you a challenge to build an app that displays all the flags from the flag game on a table view, lets you view them in a detail view, and lets you share the image and country name. It is very similar to the other projects, so I’ll move pretty quickly."

## Consolidation II (Projects 1-3)
[Day 23](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/23) is a consolidation day where you review the first three projects.  You go back over a bunch of stuff covered in the few days, but I won’t reiterate it here. He also gives you a challenge to build an app that displays all the flags from the flag game on a table view, lets you view them in a detail view, and lets you share the image and country name. It is very similar to the other projects, so I’ll move pretty quickly.

First, I added a `countries` variable to hold an array of country names and filled it up in `viewDidLoad` :
```
var countries: [String] = []

override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()

    let fm = FileManager.default
    let path = Bundle.main.resourcePath!
    let items = try! fm.contentsOfDirectory(atPath: path)

    countries = items.filter({ $0.hasSuffix("png")})
        .map({ $0.components(separatedBy: ".")[0] })

}
```
I filtered to only the items with a `png` suffix and then chopped off everything from the `.` and after with a chain of higher order functions. This leaves an array with all the country names as they appear in the image names.

Next, I edited `ViewController` to inherit from `UITableViewController`, added a table view controller as the main view in the storyboard, and set its class to be `ViewController`. This allowed me to override the `UITableViewControllerDataSource` methods:
```
override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView,
                        numberOfRowsInSection section: Int) -> Int {
    return countries.count
}

override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView,
                        cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> UITableViewCell {
    let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: "FlagCell",
                                             for: indexPath)
    let country = countries[indexPath.row]

    // Uppercase abbreviated names and capitalize full names
    cell.textLabel?.text = country.count < 3 ?
        country.uppercased() :
        country.capitalized
    cell.imageView?.image = UIImage(named: country)

    return cell
}
```

Next, I added a new view controller to the storyboard, gave it an image view, and constrained to be big enough to display a flag:

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/100days/2019-06-05-storyboard.png" alt="Screenshot of adding image view to view controller on storyboard."%}

Then I made a new `DetailViewController` class that inherits from `UIViewController` , set the new view controller’s class to it, and connected an outlet from the image view. Then I added a `setupViews()` method to set the views up:
```
private func setupViews() {
    guard let countryName = countryName else { return }
    navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem =
        UIBarButtonItem(barButtonSystemItem: .action,
                        target: self,
                        action: #selector(shareFlag))

    title = countryName.count < 3 ?
        countryName.uppercased() :
        countryName.capitalized

    flagImageView.image = UIImage(named: countryName)
    flagImageView.addBorder()
}
```

You can see that the image view uses an `addBorder()` method, which is similar to the one I made the other day. I just configured it to round the corners a little bit as well:
```
extension UIView {
    func addBorder(width: CGFloat = 1, color: UIColor = .gray) {
        self.layer.borderWidth = width
        self.layer.borderColor = color.cgColor

        self.layer.cornerRadius =
            min(self.frame.height, self.frame.width) / 24
        self.layer.masksToBounds = true
    }
}
```

You can also see that the bar button item’s action is a method called `shareFlag` so the last thing I did was add that and give a Photo Library Addition Usage to `Info.plist`:
```
@objc private func shareFlag(action: UIAlertAction! = nil) {
    guard let imageName = countryName,
        let image = UIImage(named: imageName),
        let imageData = image.jpegData(compressionQuality: 0.8) else {
            return
    }

    let items: [Any] = [imageData, imageName]
    let activityVC =
        UIActivityViewController(activityItems: items,
                                 applicationActivities: [])

    activityVC.popoverPresentationController?.barButtonItem =
        navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem

    present(activityVC, animated: true)

}
```

At the end of the day, it looks like this:

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/100days/2019-06-05-working-app.png" alt="Screenshots of working app."%}

You can find [my version of this project at the end of day 23 on Github here.](https://github.com/dillon-mce/100-days-swift-projects/tree/38ddf80a6031498d683c1f5c9a50892532848da5/Day23%20Challenge)

## Reflections
Today was definitely a good review. Most of these things are things I’m familiar with, and have done many times. But I did have to look up how to get the filenames from from the main bundle. So I can’t say I knew it all by heart.

Slowly but surely, these project apps are getting more complicated and more interesting. I’m excited to see where things go next!
