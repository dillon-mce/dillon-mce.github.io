## Consolidation Day III
[Day 32](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/32) is the third consolidation day. You review some of the important things that you learned over the last three projects: delegation, closures, `try?` and the visual format language for constraints. Then he gives you a challenge to make a simple shopping list app that lets the user add items to the list via an alert controller, clear the list, and share the list with a `UIActivityViewController`.

I wanted to take his challenge a little bit father, since I am pretty comfortable doing the things that he lays out. So the first thing I did was set up an `Item` class to hold the data and a model class for my shopping list called `ShoppingListModel`:
```
struct Item {
    var name: String
    var isCompleted = false

    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }
}

class ShoppingListModel {

    private var shoppingList: [Item] = []

    func addToList(_ itemName: String) {
        let item = Item(name: itemName)
        shoppingList.insert(item, at: 0)
    }

    func numberOfSections() -> Int {
        return 1
    }

    func numberOfRows(in section: Int) -> Int {
        return shoppingList.count
    }

    func item(for indexPath: IndexPath) -> Item {
        return shoppingList[indexPath.row]
    }

    func clearList() {
        shoppingList.removeAll()
    }
}
```

Then I started getting my table view set up. Rather than making the whole thing a `UITableViewController`, I just added a `UITableView` to the view, and made it fill the whole safe area. I added an outlet from it to `ViewController` and set it to be the delegate and data source. I did it this way so I could add a floating button in the bottom right corner for adding tasks. I added the necessary tableView methods to `ViewController`:
```
func numberOfSections(in tableView: UITableView) -> Int {
    return shoppingList.numberOfSections()
}

func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView,
               numberOfRowsInSection section: Int) -> Int {
    return shoppingList.numberOfRows(in: section)
}

func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView,
               cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> UITableViewCell {
    let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: "ItemCell",
                                             for: indexPath)
    let item = shoppingList.item(for: indexPath)

    cell.textLabel?.text = item.name

    return cell
}
```

And then set up the button in the `setupViews()` method that I call from `viewDidLoad`:
```
// In setupViews(
tableView.dataSource = self
tableView.delegate = self

addButton = UIButton()
addButton.setBackgroundImage(UIImage(named: "plus"),
                             for: .normal)
addButton.tintColor = .blue
addButton.addTarget(self,
                    action: #selector(presentAddItemAlert),
                    for: .touchUpInside)
addButton.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false

view.addSubview(addButton)

addButton.heightAnchor.constraint(equalTo: addButton.widthAnchor,
                                  multiplier: 1).isActive = true
addButton.widthAnchor.constraint(equalToConstant: 64).isActive = true
addButton.trailingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.safeAreaLayoutGuide.trailingAnchor,
                                    constant: -24).isActive = true
addButton.bottomAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.safeAreaLayoutGuide.bottomAnchor,
                                  constant: 0).isActive = true
```

This puts a little blue floating button down in the bottom right corner. I got the icon from [Icons8](https://icons8.com/ios). It looks like this:

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/100days/2019-06-15-add-item-button.jpg" alt="Screenshot of add item button."%}

The `presentAddItemAlert` method looks like this:
```
@objc func presentAddItemAlert() {
    let alertController = UIAlertController(title: "Add an item",
                                            message: nil,
                                            preferredStyle: .alert)
    var itemTextField: UITextField!
    alertController.addTextField { textField in
        textField.tintColor = .accentColor
        itemTextField = textField
    }

    let addAction = UIAlertAction(title: "Add",
                                  style: .default) { _ in
        guard let item = itemTextField.text else { return }
        self.shoppingList.addToList(item)
    }
    let cancelAction = UIAlertAction(title: "Cancel",
                                     style: .cancel)
    alertController.addAction(addAction)
    alertController.addAction(cancelAction)
    alertController.view.tintColor = .accentColor
    present(alertController, animated: true)
}
```
This presents an alert with a text field where the user can type in the name of the item they’d like to add. When/if they hit “Add”, it passes that text to the shoppingList’s `addToList()` method. So now the user has the ability to add an item to the model, but the problem is the model is not communicating that change back up to the view. (i.e. it won’t show up on the table view yet). So we need to do something about that.

I could have just added `self.tableview.insertRows()`  right after the `addToList` call, but I wanted to play around with NotificationCenter. I also wanted the updates to the view to be driven by the model, so that if updates came in from elsewhere (syncing from another device or something) those changes would show up in the view as well.  So I added this post to `ShoppingListModel`:
```
// in addToList
let userInfo: [AnyHashable: Any] = [
    Item.newIndexPath: IndexPath(row: 0, section: 0),
    Item.changeType: ItemUpdateType.add
]
NotificationCenter.default.post(name: Item.itemChangedNotification,
                                object: self,
                                userInfo: userInfo)
```

There are a couple of new things here. I added a static property on `Item` to hold a string “newIndexPath”, and one to hold the `Notification.Name`, and I added an enum to hold the type of changes I would be making to items:
```
static let itemChangedNotification = Notification.Name("ItemChanged")
static let newIndexPath = "newIndexPath"
}

enum ItemUpdateType {
    case add, remove, update, move
}
```

Then, in `ViewController` I added an observer for that notification:
```
// In setupViews
NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self,
                                       selector: #selector(updateTableView),
                                       name: Item.itemChangedNotification,
                                       object: nil)
```

`updateTableView` looks like this:
```
@objc private func updateTableView(_ notification: Notification) {
    guard let updateType = notification.userInfo?[Item.changeType] as? ItemUpdateType else { return }
    let newIndexPath = notification.userInfo?[Item.newIndexPath] as? IndexPath
    switch updateType {
    case .add:
        if let newIndexPath = newIndexPath {
            tableView.insertRows(at: [newIndexPath], with: .automatic)
        }
    default:
        print("Didn't hit one of the other cases")
        tableView.reloadData()
    }
}
```

With that, the full cycle is complete and the user can add items to the list.

Next, I wanted the user to be able to check an item off the list without deleting it, so I started looking into `UISwipeActionConfiguration` and `UIContextualAction`. After I was satisfied that that was the way to go, I needed to make some changes to be able to handle that. I thought the simplest way to go was to make `shoppingList` an array of arrays, instead of an array. So I made that change and went through and fixed all the errors it caused:
```
private var shoppingList: [[Item]] = [[],[]]

// In addToList
shoppingList[0].insert(item, at: 0)

// In numberOfSections
return 2

// In numberOfRows
return shoppingList[section].count

// In item(for:)
return shoppingList[indexPath.section][indexPath.row]

// In clearList()
for section in 0..<shoppingList.count {
    shoppingList[section].removeAll()
}
```

Then I added a couple of methods in to update the `isCompleted` property on an item:
```
func toggleCompletedOnItem(at indexPath: IndexPath) -> Bool {
    shoppingList[indexPath.section][indexPath.row].isCompleted.toggle()
    let newSection = indexPath.section == 0 ? 1 : 0
    moveItem(at: indexPath, to: IndexPath(row: 0, section: newSection))
    return true
}

func moveItem(at oldIndexPath: IndexPath,
              to newIndexPath: IndexPath) {
    let item = shoppingList[oldIndexPath.section].remove(at: oldIndexPath.row)
    shoppingList[newIndexPath.section].insert(item, at: newIndexPath.row)
    let userInfo: [AnyHashable: Any] = [
        Item.newIndexPath: newIndexPath,
        Item.oldIndexPath: oldIndexPath,
        Item.changeType: ItemUpdateType.move
    ]
    NotificationCenter.default.post(name: Item.itemChangedNotification,
                                    object: self,
                                    userInfo: userInfo)

}
```

Then, in `ViewController` I updated `updateTableView` to handle the move:
```
case .move:
    if let oldIndexPath = oldIndexPath, let newIndexPath = newIndexPath {
        tableView.moveRow(at: oldIndexPath, to: newIndexPath)
        tableView.reloadRows(at: [newIndexPath], with: .fade)
    }
```

I also updated the appearance of items in the second section like this:
```
// In tableView(cellForRowAt:)
if item.isCompleted {
    let attributedString = NSMutableAttributedString(string: item.name)
    let attributes: [NSAttributedString.Key: Any] = [
        .strikethroughStyle: 2,
        .foregroundColor: UIColor.gray
    ]
    let range = NSMakeRange(0, attributedString.length)
    attributedString.addAttributes(attributes,
                                   range: range)
    cell.textLabel?.attributedText = attributedString
} else {
    cell.textLabel?.text = item.name
}
```

With that, I could add the swipe action that would toggle the `isCompleted` state:
```
func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView,
               leadingSwipeActionsConfigurationForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath)
    -> UISwipeActionsConfiguration? {
    let completeAction = contextualCompleteAction(for: indexPath)

    let swipeConfiguration = UISwipeActionsConfiguration(actions: [completeAction])
    return swipeConfiguration
}

private func contextualCompleteAction(for indexPath: IndexPath) -> UIContextualAction {
    let item = shoppingList.item(for: indexPath)
    let action = UIContextualAction(style: .normal,
                                    title: "Complete")
    { (action, view, completion) in
        if self.shoppingList.toggleCompletedOnItem(at: indexPath) {
            completion(true)
        } else {
            completion(false)
        }
    }
    action.image = UIImage(named: "ok")
    action.backgroundColor = item.isCompleted ? .gray : .orange
    return action
}
```

And with that, you can swipe over on an item to complete it and it will be crossed out and moved to the bottom of the list.

The final two things I did were to add a `Clear All` button to the navigation bar and a share button that would let the user share a text version of the list. I needed to make one update to `clearList` to get the animations to be a little nicer. I needed to collect a list of the indexPaths and pass those in the notification:
```
var indexPaths: [IndexPath] = []
for section in 0..<shoppingList.count {
    for row in 0..<shoppingList[section].count {
        indexPaths.append(IndexPath(row: row,
                                    section: section))
    }
    shoppingList[section].removeAll()
}
let userInfo: [AnyHashable: Any] = [
    Item.changeType: ItemUpdateType.remove,
    Item.indexPaths: indexPaths
]
NotificationCenter.default.post(name: Item.itemChangedNotification,
                                object: self,
                                userInfo: userInfo)
```

Then I made a corresponding update in `ViewController.updateTableViews`:
```
case .remove:
    if let indexPaths = indexPaths {
        tableView.deleteRows(at: indexPaths, with: .automatic)
    }
```

Then I just needed to add a button and point it at that method:
```
// In setupViews
navigationItem.leftBarButtonItem =
    UIBarButtonItem(title: "Clear All",
                    style: .plain,
                    target: self,
                    action: #selector(clearList))

@objc private func clearList() {
    shoppingList.clearList()
}
```

For sharing, I added a method to `ShoppingListModel` that would generate a text version of the list in its current state:
```
func generateSharableList() -> String {
    var string = ""
    let incompleteList = shoppingList[0].map { "- [ ] \($0.name)" }
    let completeList = shoppingList[1].map { "- [x] \($0.name)" }
    string += incompleteList.joined(separator: "\n")
    if incompleteList.count > 0 { string += "\n" }
    string += completeList.joined(separator: "\n")
    return string
}
```

Then I added a button and a method to present the `UIActivityViewController`:
```
// in setupViews
navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem =
    UIBarButtonItem(barButtonSystemItem: .action,
                    target: self,
                    action: #selector(presentActivityViewController))

@objc private func presentActivityViewController() {
    let list = shoppingList.generateSharableList()
    let activityViewController =
        UIActivityViewController(activityItems: [list],
                                 applicationActivities: nil)
    present(activityViewController, animated: true)
}
```

Finally, I added a custom accent color, to make things feel a little less like a system app:
```
extension UIColor {
    static let accentColor = UIColor(red: 0.2,
                                     green: 0.2,
                                     blue: 0.75,
                                     alpha: 1)
}

// In setupViews
navigationController?.navigationBar.tintColor = UIColor.accentColor
addButton.tintColor = UIColor.accentColor

// In presetAddItemAlert
alertController.view.tintColor = UIColor.accentColor
```

When it is all said and done, it looks like this:

## Reflections
Today was a lot of fun. I tried a bunch of stuff out, and ran into things that didn’t work, and learned a lot. I spent **way** too much time working on this project that doesn’t really matter, but I feel like I gained a lot from doing it. Especially starting to work out the communication between the model and the view. I’m not totally happy with where it is yet, because it still feels pretty “pieced together” and like it might break pretty easily, but I like the direction where it is headed. I’m also not really happy with how the model is split up into two arrays. That feels like I’m doing the work in two places. It works, for now. But I’m going to try to think of a better way to do that. All in all, it was a great day though.
