## Project 3
[Day 22](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/22) is the third project day. It is a “technique” project, which focuses on one specific iOS technology in more depth than other projects. This first one is about `UIActivityViewController` and sharing stuff out of your app to other places.

The first thing you do is add a `UIBarButtonItem` to the navigation bar in `DetailViewController`:
```
let barButton = UIBarButtonItem(barButtonSystemItem: .action,
                                target: self,
                                action: #selector(shareImage))
navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem = barButton
```

This leads to an error, because we don’t have a method called `shareImage` yet, but adding it is the next thing you do:
```
@objc func shareImage() {
    guard let image = imageView.image?.jpegData(compressionQuality: 0.8) else {
        print("No image found.")
        return
    }
    let activityVC = UIActivityViewController(activityItems: [image],
                                              applicationActivities: [])
    activityVC.popoverPresentationController?.barButtonItem =
        navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem
    present(activityVC, animated: true)
}
```
Basically, you unwrap the image and turn it into a .jpg, you give that to a `UIActivityViewController`, you set the `popoverPresentationController` in case it is being presented on an iPad, and then you present it. That’s it. That’s all it takes to share an image out of your app.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/100days/2019-06-04-working-app.png" alt="Screenshot of working app"%}

The only other thing he has you do is add a line to `Info.plist` which tells iOS what you’re going to use access to the user’s photo library for. This string is presented when the app asks the user’s permission for access to their photo library. If you don’t have this, the app crashes when it needs to ask for permission.

He also gives you three challenges. The first one is to add the name of the image to be shared along with the image. That’s pretty simple, you just need to unwrap it and then include it in the `activityItems` array:
```
guard let image = imageView.image?.jpegData(compressionQuality: 0.8),
        let imageName = selectedImage else {
            print("No image found.")
            return
        }
let activityVC = UIActivityViewController(activityItems: [image, imageName],
                                          applicationActivities: [])

// ... Everything else is the same
```

The second is to add a share button to the main view of the screen that lets you share the app itself. I’m assuming you would need an App Store link to do this well, but I just put some placeholder text instead:
```
let message = """
Check out this cool new app I'm using!
It is called 'Project1'
#app_store_link#
"""

@objc func shareApp() {
    let activityVC = UIActivityViewController(activityItems: [message],
                                              applicationActivities: [])
    activityVC.popoverPresentationController?.barButtonItem =
        navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem
    present(activityVC, animated: true)
}
```
It ends up looking like this:
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/100days/2019-06-04-sharing-app.png" alt="Screenshots of sharing app challenge"%}

The final challenge was to add a bar button to show the user their score in the flag game. First, I removed the score that I had added to the title in a previous challenge, and added a `UIBarButtonItem` in the `setup` method:
```
let barButton = UIBarButtonItem(title: "Check Score",
                                style: .plain,
                                target: self,
                                action: #selector(presentScoreAlert))
navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem = barButton
```

Then I just needed to add the `presentScoreAlert` method:
```
@objc private func presentScoreAlert() {
    let ac = UIAlertController(title: "Your Score",
                               message: "\(score) points after answering \(answered) questions",
                               preferredStyle: .alert)
    let action = UIAlertAction(title: "Continue",
                               style: .default,
                               handler: { _ in self.dismiss(animated: true) })
    ac.addAction(action)
    present(ac, animated: true)
}
```
It looks like this in the app:
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/100days/2019-06-04-flag-app-score-alert.png" alt="Screenshots of flag app with new score alert."%}

## Reflections
Today was good. I don’t feel like we really took a deep dive into `UIActivityViewController`, but it is amazing to see how much functionality you get for free with just a few lines of code. And I’m sure a lot of apps have gone a long way without providing much more configuration than we covered in today’s lesson. So that is pretty cool.
