excerpt: "Day 24 is the beginning of the fourth project, which is to build a simple web browser on top of Apple’s WebKit. You configure the view controller to have a `WKWebView` as its main view. You load a default web page when the app is launched. You present the user a couple of options in an action sheet of websites that they can navigate to. And finally, you use a `WKNavigationDelegate` method to set the title in the navigation bar to the current page’s title."

## Project 4 (part 1)
[Day 24](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/24) is the beginning of the fourth project, which is to build a simple web browser on top of Apple’s WebKit. You configure the view controller to have a `WKWebView` as its main view. You load a default web page when the app is launched. You present the user a couple of options in an action sheet of websites that they can navigate to. And finally, you use a `WKNavigationDelegate` method to set the title in the navigation bar to the current page’s title.

The first thing you do is make a new project and embed the view controller it comes with into a navigation controller. After that, you override `loadView()` to set the view controller’s view to be a newly instantiated `WKWebView`:
```
var webView: WKWebView!

override func loadView() {
    webView = WKWebView()
    webView.navigationDelegate = self
    view = webView
}
```

This leads the compiler to complain because we haven’t adopted the `WKNavigationDelegate` protocol yet, so it doesn’t know that this view controller can be treated as one. Fortunately, adopting it is easy:
```
class ViewController: UIViewController, WKNavigationDelegate {
```

Next, in `viewDidLoad`, you load a default web page, once the view is loaded:
```
let url = URL(string: "https://dillon-mce.com")!
webView.load(URLRequest(url: url))
webView.allowsBackForwardNavigationGestures = true
```
The first line builds a `URL` object from the string. The second line has the webView `load` the `URLRequest` that is initialized from the `URL` object we just built. The third line enables the ability to swipe backward and forward in the webView itself, like you can in Safari.

After that, you add a bar button item to the navigation bar in `viewDidLoad`:
```
navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem =
    UIBarButtonItem(title: "Open",
                    style: .plain,
                    target: self,
                    action: #selector(openTapped))
```

This again causes the compiler to complain because there is no function called `openTapped`, so we need to add that. This function presents an action sheet to the user with a list of web pages that they can load:
```
@objc func openTapped() {
    // Make the controller
    let ac = UIAlertController(title: "Open page...",
                               message: nil,
                               preferredStyle: .actionSheet)

    // Make the actions
    let appleAction = UIAlertAction(title: "apple.com",
                                    style: .default,
                                    handler: openPage)

    let blogAction = UIAlertAction(title: "dillon-mce.com",
                                   style: .default,
                                   handler: openPage)

    let cancelAction = UIAlertAction(title: "Cancel",
                                     style: .cancel)

    // Configure the controller
    ac.addAction(appleAction)
    ac.addAction(blogAction)
    ac.addAction(cancelAction)
    ac.popoverPresentationController?.barButtonItem =
        self.navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem

    // Present it
    present(ac, animated: true)
}
```

This causes yet another error from the compiler because we don’t have an `openPage` method, so we’ll add that next. This function takes in a `UIAlertAction` and uses it’s title to decide what webpage to load:
```
func openPage(action: UIAlertAction) {
    let url = URL(string: "https://" + action.title!)!
    webView.load(URLRequest(url: url))
}
```

The app works at this point, but you add one final touch to make it feel a little nicer. You use `webView(_:didFinish:)` to change the title in the navigation bar to the title of the newly loaded webpage:
```
func webView(_ webView: WKWebView,
             didFinish navigation: WKNavigation!) {
    title = webView.title
}
```

When it’s all said and done it looks like this:

You can find [my version of this project at the end of day 24 on Github here.](https://github.com/dillon-mce/100-days-swift-projects/tree/9dfac54e2ce3b03f2fbeea5f0ccc302a16c35837/Project4)

## Reflections
I had a lot of fun with this project. I’ve never used `WebKit` before, but it seems like it brings a lot of power with not all that much work, so that’s cool. It was pretty short and simple (not complaining), but I can load whatever webpage I want my app to load after those few simple steps. I’m looking forward to seeing where we take this in the next few days.
