## Project 11 (part 2)
[Day 46](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/46) is the second part of the eleventh project. Today you get the game into a playable state. You add the slots that the balls will land in. You add a score and detect collisions to update it. And you add the ability for the user to add obstacles for the ball to hit.

First you add a function to make the slots for the ball to hit:
```
func makeSlot(at position: CGPoint, isGood: Bool) {
    let slotBase: SKSpriteNode

    if isGood {
        slotBase = SKSpriteNode(imageNamed: "slotBaseGood")
    } else {
        slotBase = SKSpriteNode(imageNamed: "slotBaseBad")
    }

    slotBase.position = position

    slotBase.physicsBody = SKPhysicsBody(rectangleOf: slotBase.size)
    slotBase.physicsBody?.isDynamic = false

    addChild(slotBase)
}
```

And then add them in `didMove(to:)`:
```
var isGood = false
for i in 0..<4 {
    let x = i * 256 + 128
    isGood.toggle()
    makeSlot(at: CGPoint(x: x, y: 0), isGood: isGood)
}
```

Then you add a glow to the background of the slots so that the function looks like this:
```
func makeSlot(at position: CGPoint, isGood: Bool) {
    let slotBase: SKSpriteNode
    let slotGlow: SKSpriteNode

    if isGood {
        slotBase = SKSpriteNode(imageNamed: "slotBaseGood")
        slotGlow = SKSpriteNode(imageNamed: "slotGlowGood")
    } else {
        slotBase = SKSpriteNode(imageNamed: "slotBaseBad")
        slotGlow = SKSpriteNode(imageNamed: "slotGlowBad")
    }

    slotBase.position = position
    slotGlow.position = position

    slotBase.physicsBody = SKPhysicsBody(rectangleOf: slotBase.size)
    slotBase.physicsBody?.isDynamic = false

    addChild(slotBase)
    addChild(slotGlow)
}
```

Then, for a little visual interest, you add a spin to the glow so that it slowly rotates:
```
// At end of makeSlot(at:isGood:)
let spin = SKAction.rotate(byAngle: .pi,
                           duration: Double.random(in: 8...15))
let spinForever = SKAction.repeatForever(spin)
slotGlow.run(spinForever)
```

Next, in order to keep track of collisions, you give names to the nodes that we care about detecting:
```
// In makeSlot(at:)
if isGood {
    slotBase = SKSpriteNode(imageNamed: "slotBaseGood")
    slotBase.name = "good"
    slotGlow = SKSpriteNode(imageNamed: "slotGlowGood")
} else {
    slotBase = SKSpriteNode(imageNamed: "slotBaseBad")
    slotBase.name = "bad"
    slotGlow = SKSpriteNode(imageNamed: "slotGlowBad")
}

// In touchesBegan(:with:)
ball.name = "ball"
```

Next you have to make the scene adopt `SKPhysicsContactDelegate` and set it as the `contactDelegate` for the physics world:
```
class GameScene: SKScene, SKPhysicsContactDelegate {

// In didMove(to:)
physicsWorld.contactDelegate = self
```

Then you have to set the `contactTestBitMask` on the ball’s `physicsBody`, to tell it what contacts we care about being notified for. To keep things simple, we just set it to the physics body’s `collisionBitMask`, which basically says “notify us about all collisions”:
```
ball.physicsBody?.contactTestBitMask = ball.physicsBody!.collisionBitMask
```

Now that we are actually being notified about contacts, you add a delegate method to do something with that information, along with a couple of helper methods to keep things a little cleaner:
```
func didBegin(_ contact: SKPhysicsContact) {
    guard let nodeA = contact.bodyA.node else { return }
    guard let nodeB = contact.bodyB.node else { return }

    if nodeA.name == "ball" {
        collisionBetween(ball: nodeA, object: nodeB)
    } else if nodeB.name == "ball" {
        collisionBetween(ball: nodeB, object: nodeA)
    }
}

func collisionBetween(ball: SKNode, object: SKNode) {
    if object.name == "good" {
        destroy(ball: ball)
    } else if object.name == "bad" {
        destroy(ball: ball)
    }
}

func destroy(ball: SKNode) {
    ball.removeFromParent()
}
```
The delegate method determines which is of the nodes is the ball and which is not and calls `collisionBetween(ball:object:)` with that information. Then, `collisionBetween(ball:object:)` determines if the object was a good or bad slot, which is where we will update the score, and then destroy’s the ball.

Then you add a `scoreLabel` and a `score` property to keep track of the value:
```
var scoreLabel: SKLabelNode!

var score = 0 {
    didSet {
        scoreLabel.text = "Score: \(score)"
    }
}

// In didMove(to:)
scoreLabel = SKLabelNode(fontNamed: "Chalkduster")
scoreLabel.text = "Score: 0"
scoreLabel.horizontalAlignmentMode = .right
scoreLabel.position = CGPoint(x: 980, y: 700)
addChild(scoreLabel)
```

And then add the updates to the score in `collisionBetween(ball:object:)`:
```
if object.name == "good" {
    destroy(ball: ball)
    score += 1
} else if object.name == "bad" {
    destroy(ball: ball)
    score -= 1
}
```

That gives us a way to keep track of the score and displays it to the user.  It is just not a very difficult game yet, because there are no obstacles. So you add an edit mode to allow the user to add some obstacles. The first thing you do is add a label to show the user which mode they are in:
```
var editLabel: SKLabelNode!

var isInEditingMode: Bool = false {
    didSet {
        editLabel.text = isInEditingMode ? "Done" : "Edit"
    }
}

// In didMove(to:)
editLabel = SKLabelNode(fontNamed: "Chalkduster")
editLabel.text = "Edit"
editLabel.position = CGPoint(x: 80, y: 700)
addChild(editLabel)
```

Then, in `touchesBegan(:with:)`, you add some code to check if the touch was on the label:
```
let objects = nodes(at: location)

if objects.contains(editLabel) {
    isInEditingMode.toggle()
} else {
    // make ball
}
```

That updates the label, but it will keep making a ball no matter which mode you are in, so now we need another `if` statement:
```
if objects.contains(editLabel) {
    isInEditingMode.toggle()
} else {
    if isInEditingMode {
        makeBox(at: location)
    } else {
        makeBall(at: location)
    }
}
```

I pulled the ball making code out to its own method, to keep things a little cleaner:
```
func makeBall(at position: CGPoint) {
    let ball = SKSpriteNode(imageNamed: "ballRed")
    ball.physicsBody = SKPhysicsBody(circleOfRadius: ball.size.width / 2)
    ball.physicsBody?.contactTestBitMask = ball.physicsBody!.collisionBitMask
    ball.physicsBody?.restitution = 0.4
    ball.position = position
    ball.name = "ball"
    addChild(ball)
}
```

And then added a `makeBox(at:)` method:
```
func makeBox(at position: CGPoint) {
    let size = CGSize(width: Int.random(in: 16...128),
                      height: 16)
    let box = SKSpriteNode(color: randomColor(),
                           size: size)
    box.zRotation = CGFloat.random(in: 0...3)
    box.position = position

    box.physicsBody = SKPhysicsBody(rectangleOf: box.size)
    box.physicsBody?.isDynamic = false

    addChild(box)
}

func randomColor() -> UIColor {
    let red = CGFloat.random(in: 0.3...1)
    let green = CGFloat.random(in: 0.3...1)
    let blue = CGFloat.random(in: 0.3...1)

    return UIColor(red: red,
                   green: green,
                   blue: blue,
                   alpha: 1)
}
```

With that, it works, but I added a few small tweaks to make the game a little more playable. Right now, you can add a ball anywhere on the screen, including right over the slot. You can also place boxes over the slots to completely block them. So I added a couple of guard statements to make sure the locations make sense:
```
// At the top of makeBall(at:)
guard position.y > 600 else { return }

// At the top of makeBox(at:)
guard position.y < 550, position.y > 100 else { return }
```

Here’s what it looks like:

## Reflections
This was really interesting to me. I’ve never made a game like this before, but I totally understand the logic of what is happening all the way through. I just didn’t know what API to use or how to structure it. So I feel like I’m learning a lot more in this project than in some of the past ones. And this is a pretty solid little game for being less than 200 lines of code.
