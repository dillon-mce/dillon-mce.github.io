excerpt: "Day 59 is the sixth consolidation day. You look back over a few of the things that you learned in the last three projects and he challenges you to make another app of your own from scratch. You review using `DispatchQueue.asynAfter`, capture lists in closures and `CGAffineTransform`. And the challenge he gives you is to make an app that displays a list of countries in a table view, and displays some information about them when you tap on the cell."

## Consolidation VI
[Day 59](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/59) is the sixth consolidation day. You look back over a few of the things that you learned in the last three projects and he challenges you to make another app of your own from scratch. You review using `DispatchQueue.asynAfter`, capture lists in closures and `CGAffineTransform`. And the challenge he gives you is to make an app that displays a list of countries in a table view, and displays some information about them when you tap on the cell.

He suggests that you get some information from Wikipedia and write some JSON for yourself to store the data about the countries, but I figured someone out there would probably have made an API for exactly that. I did a quick google search and found several and, after looking at a couple, I decided to use this one because it was simple and had all the info I wanted:  [https://restcountries.eu/](https://restcountries.eu/)

I used the sample JSON provided in their documentation to write my `Country` class, which ended up looking like this:
```
struct Country: Codable {
    let name: String
    let capital: String
    let population: Int
    let area: Double?
    let currencies: [Currency]
    let languages: [Language]
    let flag: String

struct Currency: Codable{
    let name: String?
}

struct Language: Codable{
    let name: String?
}
```
My goals for this project were to keep things as simple as possible, to keep things as clean as possible, and to get it done as fast as possible. So I stuck to the simplest `Codable` implementation that I could even though in a real app I would probably do a little bit of custom decoding to flatten this out a little bit.

After that, I wrote a `CountryController` class that makes the network call to `GET` the countries, and holds an array of them. I also made it a singleton to give me a single source of truth, if I ever decide to extend this app:
```
class CountryController {

    private var countries: [Country] = []

    static let shared = CountryController()
    private init() {}

    // MARK: - Networking
    private let baseURL = URL(string: "https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/")!

    func loadCountries(completion: @escaping () -> Void) {
        let requestURL = baseURL.appendingPathComponent("all")

        URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: requestURL) { (data, _, error) in
            if let error = error {
                NSLog("Error GETting all countries:\n\(error)")
                completion()
                return
            }

            guard let data = data else {
                NSLog("No data was returned.")
                completion()
                return
            }

            do {
                self.countries = try JSONDecoder().decode([Country].self,
                                                          from: data)
            } catch {
                NSLog("Error decoding countries:\n\(error)")
            }
            completion()

        }.resume()
    }
```

Next, I wanted to `CountryController` to have an interface for a `UITableViewController` to get the data it needs, and I also wanted to sort the countries into sections by their first letter, because that allows you to put the little letter scroll bar to the right side of the table view. First I added a few new properties and a method:
```
private var letters: [String] = []
private var sortedCountries: [String: [Country]] = [:]

private func updateLetters() {
    letters = Set(countries
        .compactMap({ $0.name.first })
        .compactMap({ String($0) }))
        .sorted()

    sortedCountries = [:]
    for letter in letters {
        sortedCountries[letter] =
            countries.filter { $0.name.hasPrefix(letter) }
    }
}
```

`letters` gives me a an array to hold all of the sections we’ll need and `sortedCountries` is a dictionary that will hold an array of `Country` for each letter. `updateLetters` Makes a `Set` out of the result of a `compactMap`  that gets the first character of each country’s name, which is then `compactMap`ed again to turn the `Character` into a `String`. This results in a `Set` of all the necessary first letters, which is then `sorted` into an `Array`. Then it cycles through each letter, and sets the dictionary value to be all of the countries that start with that letter.

Finally, I call `updateLetters()` in a `didSet` observer on `countries` so that it will stay in sync with all of the countries that we currently have:
```
private var countries: [Country] = [] {
    didSet { updateLetters() }
}
```

Next, I needed to build out the interface for the `UITableViewController`:
```
// MARK: TableView Related
func numberOfSections() -> Int {
    return letters.count
}

func title(for section: Int) -> String {
    return letters[section]
}

func sectionTitles() -> [String] {
    return letters
}

func numberOfRows(in section: Int) -> Int {
    let letter = title(for: section)
    return sortedCountries[letter]?.count ?? 0
}

func country(for indexPath: IndexPath) -> Country {
    let letter = title(for: indexPath.section)
    return (sortedCountries[letter]?[indexPath.row])!
}
```

With that, all the model side of things was pretty much ready to go, so I started building out the `UITableViewController`. I added one to `Main.storyboard` , set its class, embedded it in a `UINavigationController`, etc. All the normal stuff. And in `ViewController` I added these methods:
```
let countryController = CountryController.shared

override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()

    countryController.loadCountries {
        DispatchQueue.main.async {
            self.tableView.reloadData()
        }
    }
}

override func numberOfSections(in tableView: UITableView) -> Int {
    return countryController.numberOfSections()
}

override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView,
                        titleForHeaderInSection section: Int) -> String? {
    return countryController.title(for: section)
}

override func sectionIndexTitles(for tableView: UITableView) -> [String]? {
    return countryController.sectionTitles()
}

override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView,
                        numberOfRowsInSection section: Int) -> Int {
    return countryController.numberOfRows(in: section)
}

override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView,
                        cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> UITableViewCell {
    let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: "CountryCell",
                                             for: indexPath)
    let country = countryController.country(for: indexPath)

    cell.textLabel?.text = country.name
    let capital = country.capital == "" ? "" : "Capital: \(country.capital)"
    cell.detailTextLabel?.text = capital

    return cell
}
```
This basically just hooks up the table view to the interface I built out in `CountryController`.

Next, I added a second `UIViewController` to the storyboard, to be the detail view, I gave it a bunch of labels and an image view to display the countries flag. (I realized when I started building out the `DetailViewController` that the flag images are .svg’s, which do not play well with `UIImageView`, so I swapped it out for a `WKWebView` instead. It’s not perfect, but it works well enough for this app.) I added outlets for everything and wrote a `DetailViewController` that looks like this:
```
var country: Country?

@IBOutlet var webViewContainer: UIView!
var flagImageView: WKWebView!

@IBOutlet var capitalLabel: UILabel!
@IBOutlet var populationLabel: UILabel!
@IBOutlet var areaLabel: UILabel!
@IBOutlet var languagesLabel: UILabel!
@IBOutlet var currenciesLabel: UILabel!

override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()

    setupViews()

    updateViews()
}

private func setupViews() {
    flagImageView = WKWebView()

    flagImageView.constrainToFill(webViewContainer)
}

private func updateViews() {
    guard let country = country else { return }

    if let url = URL(string: country.flag) {
        let request = URLRequest(url: url)
        flagImageView.load(request)
    }

    title = country.name
    capitalLabel.text = country.capital
    populationLabel.text = country.formattedPopulation
    areaLabel.text = country.formattedArea
    languagesLabel.text = country.formattedLanguages
    currenciesLabel.text = country.formattedCurrencies
}
```

This uses my `constrainToFill()` helper method, which just added constraints to tie the `WKWebView` to the `webViewContainer`. It also sets most of the label's texts to be formatted versions of the data. I think this is similar to how you would do things if you were using a `ViewModel` (I’m not that familiar with the pattern), but I just added those methods to the model itself and it works great here:
```
// In Country
static let numberFormatter: NumberFormatter = {
    let numberFormatter = NumberFormatter()
    numberFormatter.numberStyle = NumberFormatter.Style.decimal
    return numberFormatter
}()

private let noDataString = "Unknown"

var formattedPopulation: String {
    return Country.numberFormatter
        .string(from: population as NSNumber) ?? noDataString
}

var formattedArea: String {
    guard let area = area else { return noDataString }
    guard let areaString = Country.numberFormatter
        .string(from: area as NSNumber) else { return noDataString }
    return  areaString + " sq. mi"
}

var formattedLanguages: String {
    let allLanguages = languages.compactMap { $0.name }
    return allLanguages.map({ "- \($0)" })
        .joined(separator: "\n")
}

var formattedCurrencies: String {
    let allCurrencies = currencies.compactMap { $0.name }
    return allCurrencies.map({ "- \($0)" })
        .joined(separator: "\n")
}
```

Finally, I just needed to pass the country to the `DetailViewController` in `prepare(for:sender:)`:
```
override func prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue,
                      sender: Any?) {
    switch segue.identifier {
    case "ShowCountrySegue":
        let detailVC = segue.destination as! DetailViewController
        guard let indexPath = tableView.indexPathForSelectedRow else { return }
        let country = countryController.country(for: indexPath)
        detailVC.country = country
    default:
        break
    }
}
```

This results in an app that looks like this:
