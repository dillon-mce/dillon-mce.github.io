# Curriculum Vitae

A little over five years ago I left my comfortable career of managing the live production environment for churches to study in the new-at-the-time iOS development program at [Lambda School (now called Bloom Institute of Technology)][lambda]. I spent basically all day every day for nine months reading and writing Swift and learning how to build iOS apps.

Ten days after finishing that course, I started a job at [Madwire][madwire] working on their [Top Rated Local][trl] app. We used a modified version of the [VIPER architecture][clean-swift], shot for 100% code coverage with our unit tests and generated all our UI programmatically – I got a crash course in all three of those things there.

After that I joined [Ibotta][ibotta], working on their [iOS app][ibotta-app] as a part of the Radicial Simplification team. Our goal was to reduce friction as much as possible for the users of the app by showing them (only) content they care about and removing unnecessary roadblocks in the process of earning rewards. I got to work with some incredible people and learned a lot about iOS architecture and working cross-functionally in a large organization while I was there.

For the last few years I have been the lead iOS Developer at [Hallow][hallow], a prayer and meditation app. At Hallow I am responsible for the iOS app as a whole: maintaining the code base, establishing best practices, and releasing new features and bug fixes on a regular cadence. I also help to hire, onboard, mentor and organize all the developers on the iOS team.

I have also been [a photographer/videographer in my free time](http://light-and-lens.com) for the last several years. I’ve noticed there is a surprising amount of overlap between doing those things and software development. You have to be able to read documentation. You have to be able to learn stuff for yourself. You have to figure out how to solve problems in creative (and sustainable, and repeatable)  ways. And you have to think about the user’s experience every step of the way.

He thinks through problems patiently, has a knack for noticing edge cases, and also seems like an amiable and friendly person to work with. He was able to answer every theoretical question and solve every problem I asked him to solve without any issue…" – Antonio Tari, [Skilled Interview](https://www.skilledinc.com/report-card/2103)
