I have put a lot of thought and time and effort into it over the years. And I see it a lot in other people‚Äôs code as well. I have seen it from both junior and senior developers. I have seen it in new code bases and mature code bases, both large and small. I think to some extent it comes from the code challenge and technical interview culture where accomplishing the goal with fewer characters is seen as better. Maybe it comes from our desire to prove ourselves and line count is a metric that is simply easy to gather. Maybe we just like the challenge, or we see it as a status symbol.\nWhatever the reasons, I think we should stop it. We should strive to write understandable code instead. In this article we will take a look at how it is saves time, it is easier to share with other people, it is easier to fix and it is easier to modify. And then I‚Äôll share a few simple tactics for writing more readable code.\nWhy Almost all the reasons I could come up with boil down to the fact that it saves time to write longer, more understandable code. It saves you time. It saves time for everyone you work with. It saves time for your users. And time is our most valuable resource. It is one of the few things we cannot get more of, so let‚Äôs try to make the most of it.\nYou read code more than you write it. Be mindful during almost any work day and you‚Äôll find that this is true. You spend time looking up existing functionality to answer your colleague‚Äôs question. You spend a bunch of time trying to find the right spot to fix a bug, and then write the one line to fix it. You spend time planning where and how to add a new feature, and then some time writing it. But writing it isn‚Äôt just a straight shot where you start at the first line and move on to each subsequent one. You reference docs or example code. You check against other parts of the code base to find reusable elements, and to make sure you‚Äôre not breaking something. You read back over the code you‚Äôve just written to make sure it does what you think it does. And so on.\nSo if you spend so much more time reading code than writing it, it makes sense to optimize for readability. Make it easier to reason about. Easier to load into your RAM when you come back to it in six months. Not only will this save you time, but it will also scale better. Other people have to understand your code. You have to understand other people‚Äôs code. Would you rather spend six hours trying to tease out what a dense block of code actually does or be able to scan it, get the gist, and move on to adding your feature? Or even worse, maybe you didn‚Äôt take the time to fully understand that dense block of code and you introduce a hard-to-find bug that will be the bane of your existence for the next year. (Not that this has ever happened to me üòÅ)\nThe more readable code is, the easier it is to debug. You are less likely to introduce bugs in the first place because they aren‚Äôt obscured by the complexity. But with the ones that do get through, they are easier to track down because the flow of the logic is obvious. There is nowhere for them to hide.\nFinally, the only constant is change. Your code base will change. The developers working on it will change. You will need to onboard new developers when they join the team and you will need to take ownership over code you didn‚Äôt write when people leave. You will need to change functionality over time. Having readable code makes all of those things easier.\nOn top of that the language/libraries you are using will probably change over time and there is a high correlation between short/clever code and the most sugary of syntax. That cutting-edge syntax is way more likely to change over time than the fundamentals. This isn‚Äôt a huge problem, but it is one more way that you are likely to waste some time if you insist on writing the shortest code.\nDo This Instead So how do we write this mythical ‚Äúreadable‚Äù code? There is no single thing you can do that will magically make your code readable. But there are many things you can do which will make it more readable. It starts with your mindset. Right now, when you sit down to write some code you may be in the habit of asking yourself something like this ‚Äúhow will I write this in the best/most efficient/most elegant/shortest way possible?‚Äù I know that was my mindset for a long time. But now I would advocate that we should instead ask ourselves ‚Äúhow can I write this in such a way that it will make the logic obvious and understandable?‚Äù Simply re-framing things in this way is a huge step in the right direction, but I‚Äôve also got a few practical tips that I try to keep in mind along the way:\nName variables for their role, not their type. Especially in strongly-typed languages like Swift, it isn‚Äôt necessary to add type information to a variable‚Äôs name. That information already lives somewhere. But the compiler can‚Äôt really know what that variable is for. Why is it there? What does it contribute to this piece of code? Give future readers a huge clue by naming that variable in a way that communicates this information.\n// don't do this let redColor = UIColor.red let array = [24, 31, 27, 45, 37] // do this instead let error = UIColor.red let userAges = [24, 31, 27, 45, 37] Do one thing at a time. Break code up into discrete pieces of logic. I often come across code where someone is trying to save time or improve performance by mashing multiple pieces of logic into one loop or something. There may be places where that becomes necessary for performance reasons, but it is very difficult to estimate performance of software ahead of time and in my experience developers are pretty bad at estimating the actual causes of performance bugs. It is much better to write it the clear and slow way first, and then test to look for places to improve the performance if necessary. Most of the time the ‚Äúslow‚Äù way will be fast enough.\n// don't do this var ages: [Int] = [] var names: [String] = [] for user in users { ages.append(user.age) names.append(user.name) } // do this instead let ages = users.map { user in user.age } let names = users.map { user in user.name } Prefer clarity over brevity. That is just a fancy way of saying that it is more important to write clear code than short code. Use as longer names for functions if it helps. Name anonymous closer arguments. Name a variable even if it is only used once. Break down large functions into smaller parts. Etc.\n// both versions assume this extension extension String { func orIfEmpty(_ replacement: String) -\u003e String { isEmpty ? replacement : self } } // don't do this, real solution I found online by googling \"Fizz Buzz solutions\" (1...15).map { (($0 % 3 == 0 ? \"Fizz\" : \"\") + ($0 % 5 == 0 ? \"Buzz\" : \"\")).orIfEmpty(\"\\($0)\") }.forEach { print($0) } // do this instead // name the function so that it is clear what it does at the call site func playFizzBuzz(from start: Int = 1, to end: Int) { playFizzBuzz(start...end) } // allow users to user whichever interface makes sense at call site func playFizzBuzz(_ range: ClosedRange) { let answers = range.map { number in // name closure arguments singleFizzBuzz(for: number) } answers.forEach { answer in print(answer) } } // pull out discrete pieces of logic to separate functions private func singleFizzBuzz(for number: Int) -\u003e String { // use language-provided functions where you can var wordReplacement = number.isMultiple(of: 3) ? \"Fizz\" : \"\" wordReplacement += number.isMultiple(of: 5) ? \"Buzz\" : \"\" return wordReplacement.orIfEmpty(\"\\(number)\") } // maybe a bit overkill for fizz buzz, but it illustrates the principle Follow the conventions of the language and codebase. If you‚Äôre an iOS developer writing Swift like I am, a good start is to read through the API design guidelines (where you‚Äôll notice some similarities with my advice here). If the code base you‚Äôre working in has agreed-upon conventions, follow them! Even if it goes against your personal preference. Clarity is more important that your opinions. If you really care about something, get the team to agree upon a new convention and offer to migrate the existing code as much as you are able.\nFinally, always be refactoring. If you don‚Äôt know how, read Martin Fowler‚Äôs book on the topic. (Even if you do know how, you should probably read it anyways.) Make a lot of small changes in the direction of cleaner/simpler/easier to understand code over time and it will add up. Any time you make changes to some part of the code stop and ask yourself this question: ‚ÄúWhat could I do in five minutes that would make it easier for the next person to understand?‚Äù Don‚Äôt waste a ton of time on it, that is the opposite of what we‚Äôre trying to do. But give it a couple minutes and you‚Äôll find something. Rename a variable. Break up the function. Add a signpost comment. Follow the boy scout rule. Always leave the code cleaner than you found it.\nWrap Up That‚Äôs all I‚Äôve got for today. Spend less time making your code short and clever and spend more time making it readable. Shift your mindset. Make lots of small changes to improve readability. They will compound into massive improvements over time. And they will save you time, they will make your code easier to change, easier to debug and easier to communicate.\nLet me know what you think. How do you go about making your code more readable? What are the cases where short and clever code is better?\n","wordCount":"1738","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-03-13T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-03-13T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://dillon-mce.com/posts/writing-readable-code/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Develop with Dillon","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://dillon-mce.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://dillon-mce.com accesskey=h title="Devlop with Dillon (Alt + H)"><img src=https://dillon-mce.com/apple-touch-icon.png alt=logo aria-label=logo height=35>Devlop with Dillon</a>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p><strong>Follow the conventions of the language and codebase.</strong> If you&rsquo;re an iOS developer writing Swift like I am, a good start is to read through <a href=https://www.swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/>the API design guidelines</a> (where you&rsquo;ll notice some similarities with my advice here). If the code base you&rsquo;re working in has agreed-upon conventions, follow them! Even if it goes against your personal preference. Clarity is more important that your opinions. If you really care about something, get the team to agree upon a new convention and offer to migrate the existing code as much as you are able.</p><p>Finally, <strong>always be refactoring.</strong> If you don&rsquo;t know how, read <a href=https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html>Martin Fowler&rsquo;s book on the topic</a>. (Even if you do know how, you should probably read it anyways.) Make a lot of small changes in the direction of cleaner/simpler/easier to understand code over time and it will add up. Any time you make changes to some part of the code stop and ask yourself this question: &ldquo;What could I do in five minutes that would make it easier for the next person to understand?&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t waste a ton of time on it, that is the opposite of what we&rsquo;re trying to do. But give it a couple minutes and you&rsquo;ll find something. Rename a variable. Break up the function. Add a signpost comment. Follow the boy scout rule. Always leave the code cleaner than you found it.</p><h2 id=wrap-up>Wrap Up<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#wrap-up>#</a></h2><p>That&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve got for today. Spend less time making your code short and clever and spend more time making it readable. Shift your mindset. Make lots of small changes to improve readability. They will compound into massive improvements over time. And they will save you time, they will make your code easier to change, easier to debug and easier to communicate.</p><p>Let me know what you think. How do you go about making your code more readable? What are the cases where short and clever code is better?</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://dillon-mce.com/tags/swift/>Swift</a></li></ul><div class=share-buttons><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="share Writing Short Code Isn't The Point on twitter" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet/?text=Writing%20Short%20Code%20Isn%27t%20The%20Point&url=https%3a%2f%2fdillon-mce.com%2fposts%2fwriting-readable-code%2f&hashtags=Swift"><svg viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M449.446.0C483.971.0 512 28.03 512 62.554v386.892C512 483.97 483.97 512 449.446 512H62.554c-34.524.0-62.554-28.03-62.554-62.554V62.554c0-34.524 28.029-62.554 62.554-62.554h386.892zM195.519 424.544c135.939.0 210.268-112.643 210.268-210.268.0-3.218.0-6.437-.153-9.502 14.406-10.421 26.973-23.448 36.935-38.314-13.18 5.824-27.433 9.809-42.452 11.648 15.326-9.196 26.973-23.602 32.49-40.92-14.252 8.429-30.038 14.56-46.896 17.931-13.487-14.406-32.644-23.295-53.946-23.295-40.767.0-73.87 33.104-73.87 73.87.0 5.824.613 11.494 1.992 16.858-61.456-3.065-115.862-32.49-152.337-77.241-6.284 10.881-9.962 23.601-9.962 37.088.0 25.594 13.027 48.276 32.95 61.456-12.107-.307-23.448-3.678-33.41-9.196v.92c0 35.862 25.441 65.594 59.311 72.49-6.13 1.686-12.72 2.606-19.464 2.606-4.751.0-9.348-.46-13.946-1.38 9.349 29.426 36.628 50.728 68.965 51.341-25.287 19.771-57.164 31.571-91.8 31.571-5.977.0-11.801-.306-17.625-1.073 32.337 21.15 71.264 33.41 112.95 33.41z"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="share Writing Short Code Isn't The Point on linkedin" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3a%2f%2fdillon-mce.com%2fposts%2fwriting-readable-code%2f&title=Writing%20Short%20Code%20Isn%27t%20The%20Point&summary=Writing%20Short%20Code%20Isn%27t%20The%20Point&source=https%3a%2f%2fdillon-mce.com%2fposts%2fwriting-readable-code%2f"><svg viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M449.446.0C483.971.0 512 28.03 512 62.554v386.892C512 483.97 483.97 512 449.446 512H62.554c-34.524.0-62.554-28.03-62.554-62.554V62.554c0-34.524 28.029-62.554 62.554-62.554h386.892zM160.461 423.278V197.561h-75.04v225.717h75.04zm270.539.0V293.839c0-69.333-37.018-101.586-86.381-101.586-39.804.0-57.634 21.891-67.617 37.266v-31.958h-75.021c.995 21.181.0 225.717.0 225.717h75.02V297.222c0-6.748.486-13.492 2.474-18.315 5.414-13.475 17.767-27.434 38.494-27.434 27.135.0 38.007 20.707 38.007 51.037v120.768H431zM123.448 88.722C97.774 88.722 81 105.601 81 127.724c0 21.658 16.264 39.002 41.455 39.002h.484c26.165.0 42.452-17.344 42.452-39.002-.485-22.092-16.241-38.954-41.943-39.002z"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="share Writing Short Code Isn't The Point on reddit" href="https://reddit.com/submit?url=https%3a%2f%2fdillon-mce.com%2fposts%2fwriting-readable-code%2f&title=Writing%20Short%20Code%20Isn%27t%20The%20Point"><svg viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M449.446.0C483.971.0 512 28.03 512 62.554v386.892C512 483.97 483.97 512 449.446 512H62.554c-34.524.0-62.554-28.03-62.554-62.554V62.554c0-34.524 28.029-62.554 62.554-62.554h386.892zM446 265.638c0-22.964-18.616-41.58-41.58-41.58-11.211.0-21.361 4.457-28.841 11.666-28.424-20.508-67.586-33.757-111.204-35.278l18.941-89.121 61.884 13.157c.756 15.734 13.642 28.29 29.56 28.29 16.407.0 29.706-13.299 29.706-29.701.0-16.403-13.299-29.702-29.706-29.702-11.666.0-21.657 6.792-26.515 16.578l-69.105-14.69c-1.922-.418-3.939-.042-5.585 1.036-1.658 1.073-2.811 2.761-3.224 4.686l-21.152 99.438c-44.258 1.228-84.046 14.494-112.837 35.232-7.468-7.164-17.589-11.591-28.757-11.591-22.965.0-41.585 18.616-41.585 41.58.0 16.896 10.095 31.41 24.568 37.918-.639 4.135-.99 8.328-.99 12.576.0 63.977 74.469 115.836 166.33 115.836s166.334-51.859 166.334-115.836c0-4.218-.347-8.387-.977-12.493 14.564-6.47 24.735-21.034 24.735-38.001zM326.526 373.831c-20.27 20.241-59.115 21.816-70.534 21.816-11.428.0-50.277-1.575-70.522-21.82-3.007-3.008-3.007-7.882.0-10.889 3.003-2.999 7.882-3.003 10.885.0 12.777 12.781 40.11 17.317 59.637 17.317 19.522.0 46.86-4.536 59.657-17.321 3.016-2.999 7.886-2.995 10.885.008 3.008 3.011 3.003 7.882-.008 10.889zm-5.23-48.781c-16.373.0-29.701-13.324-29.701-29.698.0-16.381 13.328-29.714 29.701-29.714 16.378.0 29.706 13.333 29.706 29.714.0 16.374-13.328 29.698-29.706 29.698zM160.91 295.348c0-16.381 13.328-29.71 29.714-29.71 16.369.0 29.689 13.329 29.689 29.71.0 16.373-13.32 29.693-29.689 29.693-16.386.0-29.714-13.32-29.714-29.693z"/></svg></a></div></footer></article></main><a href=#top aria-label="go to top" title="Go to Top (Alt + G)" class=top-link id=top-link accesskey=g><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 12 6" fill="currentcolor"><path d="M12 6H0l6-6z"/></svg></a><footer class=footer><span>&copy;
